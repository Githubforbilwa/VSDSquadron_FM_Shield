## 4. Schematic Design
The schematic outlines the matrix design for key switches, LED drivers, and VSDSquadron FM connections.

Key Features:
* Matrix configuration for keyboard rows and columns.
* Integrated LED drivers for lighting control.
* Connection to the VSDSquadron FM framework.

---

## 5. PCB Layout
The PCB layout ensures optimal routing and signal integrity while accommodating all components.

Front Copper Layer:

Back Copper Layer:

Key Features:
* Carefully routed traces for LED control.
* Footprints for standard MX-style mechanical switches.
* Compact design with minimal interference.

## 6. ERC and DRC Checks
ERC (Electrical Rule Check): Verified for schematic consistency and correct pin configurations.
DRC (Design Rule Check): Passed for trace clearances, via sizes, and other manufacturing constraints.

## 7. 3D Viewer
The 3D viewer in KiCad provides a realistic preview of the PCB, showing component placement and board dimensions.
Use the 3D Viewer feature in KiCad to visualize your design before manufacturing.

## 8. Bill of Materials (BOM)
A detailed BOM is included, listing all components:

Mechanical Switches: Compatible with MX-style switches.
LEDs: WS2812B addressable LEDs.
Download the BOM file: BOM.csv (include if available).
